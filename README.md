# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: is the systematic application of engineering princiles, methods and tools to the develoment and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?is the systematic application of engineering princiles, methods and tools to the develoment and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.While programming is centered around the code, software engineering is extended over the entire life cycle of the software, from conception to maintenance,emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. waterfall - sequential approach with distinct phases,2. Agile- entails an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change,3.Scrum- Agile framework emphasizing on small, self-organizing teams working in short iterations called srints.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development-Agile uses a more iterative and focused approach on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change while waterfall uses a sequential approach with distint phases such as requirements,design,implementation. What are the key differences- waterfall has a fixed timeline while agile is a lot more flexible and accounts for exerimenting with different directions.what scenarios might each be preferred? waterfall method is often used when there is a high level of reliability needed for the project while Agile method is mostly for usage scenarios or scenarios which describe a real-world example of how one or more people or organizations interact with a system.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?-is the processof defining,documenting,and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.  Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle- Requirements engineering ensures that the problem a client wants solved is clearly defined and the solution is both accurate and effective. Essentially it transforms real-world problems into clear specification for a highly functional solution.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design-Modularity is aimed at creating software in a way thta minimizes dependecies among the components of a system. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? By localizing the impact of changes, hence simplifing maintenance and enhances the understandibility of the system.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing)-Unit testing detects errors individually from every component by individually testing them. 2.Integrating testing involves two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test.3.System Testing involves testing complete and integrated softwares. 4. Acceptance Testing is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilledbefore delivery.
 Why is testing crucial in software development? Testing identifies errors so that they can be removed to obtain a product with great quality.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems-Software tools thta help software teams manage changes to source code over time. why are they important in software development? They facilitate coordination,sharing and collaboration across entire software development teams. Give examples of popular version control systems and their features-Git(rogramming language-python,c,c++),mercurial(programming language- C,python),Svn(programming language-C)
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager-serves as liaisons between the developmwnt team and the other stakeholders in a software project by communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resources. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?Responsibilities include planning,scheduling and managing the delivery of the software. Challenges include skill gap,missing requirements, keeping with latest trends, not enough planning ahead and setting the bar too high in terms of expectations.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance-is the process of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.explain the different types of maintenance activities-corrective(fixing defects), adaptive(adapting to the environment),perfective(enhancing attributes) and preventive(preventing problems).Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? withou maintenance, any software will be absolete and essentially useless over time.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face-privacy, accuracy,accessibilty and effects on quality of life. How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Software engineers should ask themselves ethical questionss before they begin a project.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
